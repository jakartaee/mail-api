/**
 * Folder is an abstract class that represents a folder for mail
 * messages. Subclasses implement protocol specific Folders.<p>
 *
 * Folders can contain Messages, other Folders or both, thus providing
 * a tree-like hierarchy rooted at the Store's default folder. (Note 
 * that some Folder implementations may not allow both Messages and 
 * other Folders in the same Folder).<p>
 *
 * The interpretation of folder names is implementation dependent.
 * The different levels of hierarchy in a folder's full name
 * are separated from each other by the hierarchy delimiter 
 * character.<p>
 *
 * The case-insensitive full folder name (that is, the full name
 * relative to the default folder for a Store) <strong>INBOX</strong>
 * is reserved to mean the "primary folder for this user on this
 * server".  Not all Stores will provide an INBOX folder, and not
 * all users will have an INBOX folder at all times.  The name
 * <strong>INBOX</strong> is reserved to refer to this folder,
 * when it exists, in Stores that provide it. <p>
 *
 * A Folder object obtained from a Store need not actually exist
 * in the backend store. The <code>exists</code> method tests whether
 * the folder exists or not. The <code>create</code> method
 * creates a Folder. <p>
 *
 * A Folder is initially in the closed state. Certain methods are valid
 * in this state; the documentation for those methods note this.  A
 * Folder is opened by calling its 'open' method. All Folder methods,
 * except <code>open</code>, <code>delete</code> and 
 * <code>renameTo</code>, are valid in this state. <p>
 *
 * The only way to get a Folder is by invoking the 
 * <code>getFolder</code> method on Store, Folder, or Session, or by invoking 
 * the <code>list</code> or <code>listSubscribed</code> methods 
 * on Folder. Folder objects returned by the above methods are not 
 * cached by the Store. Thus, invoking the <code>getFolder</code> method
 * with the same folder name multiple times will return distinct Folder 
 * objects.  Likewise for the <code>list</code> and <code>listSubscribed</code>
 * methods. <p>
 *
 * The Message objects within the Folder are cached by the Folder.
 * Thus, invoking <code>getMessage(msgno)</code> on the same message number
 * multiple times will return the same Message object, until an 
 * expunge is done on this Folder. <p>
 *
 * Message objects from a Folder are only valid while a Folder is open
 * and should not be accessed after the Folder is closed, even if the
 * Folder is subsequently reopened.  Instead, new Message objects must
 * be fetched from the Folder after the Folder is reopened. <p>
 *
 * Note that a Message's message number can change within a
 * session if the containing Folder is expunged using the expunge
 * method.  Clients that use message numbers as references to messages
 * should be aware of this and should be prepared to deal with this
 * situation (probably by flushing out existing message number references
 * and reloading them). Because of this complexity, it is better for
 * clients to use Message objects as references to messages, rather than
 * message numbers. Expunged Message objects still have to be
 * pruned, but other Message objects in that folder are not affected by the 
 * expunge.

     * <li>
     * The folder can contain subfolders as well as messages: <br>
     * If the folder is empty (no messages or subfolders), it
     * is removed. If the folder contains no subfolders, but only messages,
     * then all messages are removed. The folder itself is then removed.
     * In both the above cases, an appropriate FolderEvent is
     * generated by the Store and this folder. <p>

     *  <ol>
     *   <li> The operation fails, irrespective of whether this folder
     * contains messages or not. Some implementations might elect to go
     * with this simple approach. The delete() method returns false.

     * HOLDS_FOLDERS | HOLDS_MESSAGES to HOLDS_FOLDERS. Thus new 
     * messages cannot be added to this folder, but new subfolders can
