/**
 * The <code>UIDFolder</code> interface is implemented by Folders 
 * that can support the "disconnected" mode of operation, by providing 
 * unique-ids for messages in the folder. This interface is based on
 * the IMAP model for supporting disconnected operation. <p>
 *
 * A Unique identifier (UID) is a positive long value, assigned to
 * each message in a specific folder. Unique identifiers are assigned
 * in a strictly <strong>ascending</strong> fashion in the mailbox. 
 * That is, as each message is added to the mailbox it is assigned a 
 * higher UID than the message(s) which were added previously. Unique
 * identifiers persist across sessions. This permits a client to 
 * resynchronize its state from a previous session with the server. <p>
 *
 * Associated with every mailbox is a unique identifier validity value.
 * If unique identifiers from an earlier session fail to persist to 
 * this session, the unique identifier validity value 
 * <strong>must</strong> be greater than the one used in the earlier
 * session. <p>
 *
 * Refer to <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2060.txt">RFC 2060</A>
 * for more information.
 *
 * All the Folder objects returned by the default IMAP provider implement
 * the UIDFolder interface.  Use it as follows:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *
 * 	Folder f = store.getFolder("whatever");
 *	UIDFolder uf = (UIDFolder)f;
 *	long uid = uf.getUID(msg);
 *
 * </pre></blockquote><p>
